Billing Report

This report pulls individual transactions of works entered into an accounting system SQL Server database. A user may have many transactions per day. Each transaction represents a task that was completed. The users have different possible categories such as Permenant worker, temporary worker, PT to FT, Target Hours change, Ratio Hours change, etc. Each situation has a different way that statistcal information is calculated. This application retrieves those transactions, runs the appropriate calculations and then inserts them into SQL Server database tables for retrieval by a different application. - Roberto
